## Project Summary:

This project showcases a full end-to-end Business Intelligence (BI) solution analyzing Amazon’s sales performance across regions, years, product categories, and channels.
Using Tableau, I transformed raw transactional data into interactive dashboards that support business, finance, and operations teams with actionable insights.

### The project consists of three dashboards:

Homepage Dashboard → High-level KPIs & geographic profit insights

2. How do online and offline sales channels compare?
